  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding Payroll Tax Calculation in the UK</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Payroll taxes in the United Kingdom, including PAYE (Pay As You Earn) income tax and National Insurance (NI) contributions, are essential components deducted from employees' salaries. These deductions fund various public services and benefits, ensuring the smooth functioning of the country's social security system.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    The <a href="https://payrolltaxcalculator.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayrollTaxCalculator.co.uk Tax Calculator</a> is a valuable tool for individuals to estimate their tax liabilities accurately. It calculates PAYE income tax based on progressive tax bands and National Insurance contributions, which vary depending on earnings thresholds. Whether you receive payments weekly, monthly, or annually, this tool simplifies the complex task of payroll tax calculation.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    PAYE income tax rates range from 20% to 45% of taxable income, with adjustments for personal allowances and deductions. National Insurance contributions consist of Class 1 (Employee and Employer contributions), Class 2, and Class 4 contributions, each serving different purposes such as funding state pensions, healthcare, and other benefits.
  </p>
  <p className="mb-4">
    For detailed information on PAYE and National Insurance, visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/income-tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Income Tax</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Insurance</a> pages. These resources provide authoritative guidance on tax rates, allowances, and obligations in the UK.

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions about Payroll Taxes</h3>
    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">What is PAYE income tax?</h4>
    <p className="mb-4">
      PAYE (Pay As You Earn) is the UK's system for deducting income tax from an employee's salary before it's paid. Employers calculate and withhold the correct amount of tax each pay period.
      Learn more about PAYE on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/income-tax/how-you-pay-income-tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Income Tax</a> page.
    </p>
    
    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">How are National Insurance contributions calculated?</h4>
    <p className="mb-4">
      National Insurance contributions are calculated based on earnings. Employees pay Class 1 contributions, while self-employed individuals pay Class 2 and Class 4 contributions.
      For more details, visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK National Insurance</a> page.
    </p>
    
    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">What are the current tax bands and rates?</h4>
    <p className="mb-4">
      The UK's income tax rates range from 20% to 45%, depending on income. The basic rate is 20%, the higher rate is 40%, and the additional rate is 45%.
      Check the latest tax bands and rates on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Income Tax Rates</a> page.
    </p>
    
    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Do I need to pay National Insurance if I'm self-employed?</h4>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Yes, self-employed individuals pay Class 2 and Class 4 National Insurance contributions based on their profits.
      Learn more about self-employed National Insurance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK National Insurance Rates</a> page.
    </p>
    
    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">How do deductions for pensions and benefits affect my take-home pay?</h4>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Pension contributions and benefit deductions reduce your taxable income, lowering the amount of PAYE tax and National Insurance you pay.
